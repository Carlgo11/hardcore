# Hardcore
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Carlgo11/hardcore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Carlgo11/hardcore)

## What is this?
Hardcore is a ultra-hardcore Minecraft plugin (Spigot based).
This is a replacement for an old outdated plugin I had a few years ago.

I decided to completely redesign the plugin from scratch and publish the source code in the process.

## Can I use the code?

Yes, this project is licensed under GPLv3.
For more information on GPLv3, see [tldrlegal](https://www.tldrlegal.com/l/gpl-3.0) or [LICENSE](LICENSE.md).

For a short summery,
* You may run my code.
* You may make changes to my code as long as you give me credit for the contributions I have done.
* You may __not__ claim that my code is your own or use any other license than GPLv3.


## Requirements

If you want to run the plugin you will need these things:

* Java 8
* A spigot server
* Some knowledge on how Minecraft servers work and how to edit configs.
