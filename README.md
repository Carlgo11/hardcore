# Hardcore
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Carlgo11/hardcore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Carlgo11/hardcore) 

## What is this?
Hardcore is a ultra-hardcore Minecraft plugin (Spigot based).
This is a replacement for an old outdated plugin I had a few years ago.

I decided to completely redesign the plugin from scratch and publish the source code in the process.
